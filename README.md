# World Cup News

This project consists is a Mid Term Project for the WMAD Course at Ciccc.

It was asked to develop a hole website using HTML and CSS technologies, but I've decided to use React with Tailwindcss to develop the hole website.

## What the website is all about

The website consists in a landing page for a Soccer World Cup news, where people can have a bit of information about the service and at the same time can join the newsletter by filling a very basic form that asks for name and email.

## Technologies and Libraries Utilized

- React with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for the stylish of the pages
- Swiper library to the swiper news on the page
- EmailJs API that is responsible to send a email confirmation directly to the email put on the form

## Deployement

The application was deployed using Vercel and can be found at this link: [World Cup News](https://world-cup-news.vercel.app/)
